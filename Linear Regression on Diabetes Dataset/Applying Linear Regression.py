#Applying logical regression to a scenario
#################################################################################
##A data of students, 50 males and 50 females, containing 400 observations. There
##are 3 explanatory variables, namely; GRE, GPA and RANK. Treat the variables GRE
##and GPA as continuous and the RANK variable only takes values [1, 4]. Institutions
##with a rank of 1 have the highest prestige, while those with a rank of 4 have the
##lowest.

##These are the 4 applications:
##● The aim is to model the probabilities of a response variable as a function of
##some explanatory variables.
##-Answer to application 1: “success” of admission as a function of gender.

##● The aim is to perform descriptive discriminative analysis such as describing
##the difference between individuals in separate groups as a function of
##explanatory variables.
## - Answer: The relationship between the rank and GRE and GPA

##● The aim is to predict probabilities that individuals fall into two categories of
##the binary response as a function of some explanatory variables.
## - Answer: If a GPA is low and the GRE high or a high GPA and a low GRE

##● The aim is to classify individuals into two categories based on explanatory
##variables.
#Answer - High performing and low performing students
