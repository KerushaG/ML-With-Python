# ML-With-Python
 Through these projects I was introduced to Machine Learning, which involved working with datasets, plotting graphs and using training and test data on algorithms for the most accurate predictions of data and to find relations between variables. 
 
## Plots of Iris Flower Dataset
Athough a simple project, this was the main introduction to working with datasets and plotting them into figures. 

## Linear Regression On Diabetes Dataset
This project worked with one feature from 10, of a diabetes dataset, and drew the line of best fit through the data.

## K-Means Algorithm
This is one of the algorithms used for unsupervised learning, where the data is organized around a number of medians, that relate to the number of clusters you want from the data. In this task I also learnt how to read from and work with csv files.
